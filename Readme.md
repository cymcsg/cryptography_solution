## Cryptography Solution



The security issue in network communication is what we need to face at all times. Encryption is a very common method we use in communication. ``Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman(ECDH)``  is an anonymous key agreement protocol that allows two parties, each having an elliptic-curve public–private key pair, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel which using ``Elliptic-curve cryptography(ECC)`` and ``Diffie–Hellman key exchange``.

In our daily production, we often need the cooperation between the server side and the frontend (including the web side, iOS side and Android side). To transfer and store  ``password`` and ``token`` are also problems which we need to face. So the **Cryptography Solution** comes. It provide the cryptography solution for the **server side and the frontend (including the web side, iOS side and Android side)**.

网络通信中的安全问题是我们时刻需要面对的。通信加密是我们非常常用的方法。``椭圆曲线Diffie-Hellman（ECDH）``是一种匿名密钥协商协议，允许双方（每个都具有椭圆曲线公钥 - 私钥对）在不安全的信道上建立共享秘密，使用``椭圆曲线加密（ECC）`` 和``Diffie-Hellman密钥交换``。

在我们的日常生产中，我们经常需要服务器端和前端（包括Web端，iOS端和Android端）之间的合作。 转移和存储密码和令牌也是我们需要面对的问题。 所以 **Cryptography Solution**来了。 它为**服务器端和前端（包括Web端，iOS端和Android端）提**供加密解决方案。
